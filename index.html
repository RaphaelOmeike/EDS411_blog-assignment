  <h1>The Founding of Flutterwave</h1>

  <p>
    Flutterwave was founded in 2016 by a team of Nigerian entrepreneurs led by Iyinoluwa Aboyeji 
    and Olugbenga “GB” Agboola. The company emerged to solve a major problem in Africa—seamless 
    and reliable payment infrastructure. At the time, African businesses struggled with fragmented 
    banking systems, unreliable cross-border transactions, and poor access to global payment channels. 
    Flutterwave set out to build a unified payment solution that could connect African merchants to the 
    global economy.

    From its inception, Flutterwave positioned itself as a technology-first financial company. 
    Its early mission was simple: provide the APIs and the infrastructure that businesses needed to 
    process payments locally and internationally. By partnering with major banks and financial institutions, 
    Flutterwave quickly gained trust and became known for its speed, reliability, and ease of integration. 
    This foundation helped the company scale rapidly across multiple African countries.

    Over the years, Flutterwave has launched several products that expanded its ecosystem, including 
    Rave (its payment gateway) and Flutterwave Store (a zero-code commerce platform). The company has also partnered 
    with global giants like PayPal, Visa, and Mastercard. Today, Flutterwave is considered one of Africa’s 
    leading fintech companies, empowering millions of businesses and individuals across the continent.
